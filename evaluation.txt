Evaluation:

The tutorial provides a short introduction to the history of the package, though it could be more relevant to the uses the reader is likely interested in like a study using the library. (Though the use of the package touches that usage fairly well).

The structure of the tutorial is organized with a quick takeaway, the description of the package, and major steps for the tutorial. The descriptions of code samples decreases as they become more detailed which should be corrected.
	- there was trouble finding parameter meanings later on

We will see if it is reproducible.

The presentation appears well in my observation.
