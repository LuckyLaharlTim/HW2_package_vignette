Thinking of doing Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation of something like [water surface quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235218642100540X) like in the paper linked. This will use **gstat** and likely feature some maps.

```{r created_data}
X = c(61,63,64,68,71,73,75)
Y = c(139,140,129,128,140,141,128)
Z = c(477,696,227,646,606,791,783)

x_unknown = c(65,72,66,60,59)
y_unknown = c(135,139,133,142,138)
X1 = 65; Y1 = 137

# What is Z1 or z_unknown?
```


```{r simple_prediction_w_created_data}
dt = data.frame(X,Y,Z)
coordinates(dt) <- ~X+Y
unknownDT = data.frame(x_unknown,y_unknown)

coordinates(unknownDT) <- ~x_unknown+y_unknown

# prediction here
idwModel <- idw(Z ~1, dt, unknownDT, maxdist = Inf, idp = 2)

predZ = idwModel@data$var1.pred
View(predZ)

pred_dt <- data.frame(x_unknown, y_unknown, predZ)
```
